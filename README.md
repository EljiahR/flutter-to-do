# Flutter To-Do Application

Welcome to my Flutter To-Do application! This project was developed as a practice exercise to learn the basics of Flutter.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks to keep your list up-to-date.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Mark as Completed**: Check off tasks that you've accomplished.
